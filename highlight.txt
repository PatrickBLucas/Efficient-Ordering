This is my first *major* Google Action Script project.  This allows a user to download an XLSX file from our database, prunes out columns that aren't needed, adds columns to incorporate vendor data including their item numbers, full box quantity, etc.  It then tabulates how much to order based on our sales history.  It creates a CSV file that can be uploaded to the vendor's site which generates a PO with the current pricing making sure we are ordering the things that sell at the right price so we can set optimal profit margins.
